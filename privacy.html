    <h1>Privacy Policy for Veil for Safari</h1>
    
    <p>Joakim Sören Johansson built the Veil for Safari extension as a Commercial application. This SERVICE is provided by Joakim Sören Johansson and is intended for use as is.</p>
    
    <p>This page is used to inform users regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information for anyone who decides to use our Service.</p>
    
    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    
    <p>Veil for Safari does not collect any personal information at all. The extension operates entirely locally on your device.</p>
    
    <h2>Browser Storage</h2>
    
    <p>Veil for Safari uses browser storage (specifically browser.storage.sync) to save your extension preferences, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Whether the extension is enabled</li>
        <li>Blur mode settings</li>
        <li>Any custom keywords you've chosen to block</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This information is stored locally in your browser and is not transmitted to any external servers.</p>
    
    <h2>Content Filtering</h2>
    
    <p>Veil for Safari analyzes the content of web pages you visit solely to identify content matching your filter preferences. This analysis:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Is performed entirely on your device</li>
        <li>Does not store the content of websites you visit</li>
        <li>Does not transmit any browsing data to external servers</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    
    <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.</p>
    
    <p>This Service does not use cookies at all. The extension does not create, read, modify, store, or transmit any cookies.</p>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    
    <p>Veil for Safari does not use any third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    
    <p>Since all operation is done locally on your device and no data is transmitted externally, your data remains entirely under your control.</p>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    
    <p>These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
    
    <p>This policy is effective as of April 7, 2025.</p>
